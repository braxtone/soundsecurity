# We Goofed
Unfortunately, the audio for this episode was irrevocably mutilated by YouTube Live/Google
Hangouts. It's a shame because we got to have the most awesome [Sean](https://twitter.com/unixist)
(check out his projects on [Github](https://github.com/unixist))
join us in the discussion. We've included the show notes below so you can at least catch up on the
stories we covered. See you again in a few weeks!
