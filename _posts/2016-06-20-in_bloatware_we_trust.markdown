    title: "Out-of-Box Exploitation: A Security Analysis of OEM Updaters"
    comment: "OEM laptop vendors for a long time have included their own bits of
    software in with retail sales. These bits included update mechanisms which
    appear to be poorly designed. Duo Security, a 2 factor auth company, looks
    into the matter and writes down their results."

    title: "Typosquatting in Programming Language Package Managers"
    comment: "Nikolai Tschacher, an undergraduate Informatics student from
    University of Hamburg, released a paper detailing his work at analyzing
    typos made by programmers when working with package managers. He furthers
    the work of a few earlier security researchers and his approach to
    collecting data for his research brings up questions on what is acceptable
    to collect."

    title: "SELinux is beyond saving at this point"
    comment: "Chris Siebenmann writes about SELinux's usability nightmare and
    how it is beyond saving. When you are too hard headed to listen to your
    customers, you may be the one who is wrong."

  title: "Russians Hacking DNC Computers"
  comment: "A group of hackers, presumably Russian at this point-in-time, broke
  into the Democratic National Committe's (DNC) servers and subsequently
  released a treasure drove of confidential documents out onto the Internet.
  What does this mean to folks in a corporate environment? Is APT1 now DNC1?
  Will we continue asking rhetorical questions you can't answer?"
