    comment: "Threat intel still not all that valuable - Mobile devices not hugely owned, plus what could you really do with one if you did own it? - 99.9% of the exploited vulnerabilities were compromised more than a year after the CVE was published. - 70-90% (depending on the source and organization) of malware samples are unique to a single organization. - Average cost per record lost was 58Â¢"
