    title: "How Netflix Gives All Its Engineers SSH Access To Instances Running In Production"
    comment: "One of the ways Netflix enables engineering velocity is with a culture of 'freedom and responsibility' that empowers individuals with the freedom to do what is needed to get the job done.

Russell Lewis reviews a few approaches used in the industry to secure SSH bastions (aka jumpboxes) and evaluates them through the lens of Netflixâ€™s security culture."
