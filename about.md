This is the site for the Sound Security Podcast. Sound Security is made up of Braxton and Osman, two
InfoSec nerds from the PugetSound who love to rant and argue about the rotating cast of miracle cure
vendors, brilliant researchers, forced acronyms, groan-inducing vulnerabilities, gasp-inducing vulnerabilities,
pointy-haired bosses, and other-hyphenated-things that make up our beloved security industry.

For more info on your two hosts, check out their sites:
